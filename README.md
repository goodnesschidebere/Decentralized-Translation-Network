# 🌐 Decentralized Translation Network

Welcome to the Decentralized Translation Network (DTN), a Web3 platform built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts! This project tackles the real-world problem of language barriers in global content creation, such as articles, videos, apps, and documents. Traditional translation services are often centralized, expensive, prone to errors, and unfair to translators. DTN enables content creators to crowdsource accurate translations from native speakers, who verify each other's work and earn ongoing royalties based on content usage. It's decentralized, transparent, and incentivizes quality through blockchain rewards.

## ✨ Features

- 📝 Submit multilingual content for translation requests
- 🌍 Native speakers provide and verify translations in a decentralized manner
- 💰 Earn royalties for translators and verifiers based on content views or usage
- 🔍 Immutable records of translations and verifications for trust and auditability
- 🏆 Reputation system to reward high-quality contributors and penalize bad actors
- ⚖️ Dispute resolution for contested translations
- 🔒 Secure escrow for payments until verifications are complete
- 📊 Governance for community-driven updates to the platform

## 🛠 How It Works

**For Content Creators**
- Register your account and submit original content with a hash, target languages, and a bounty for translations.
- Use the escrow contract to lock funds (in STX or a custom token) for rewards.
- Once translations are submitted and verified, approve the final version and release royalties.
- Track usage metrics to automate ongoing royalty payouts.

**For Translators (Native Speakers)**
- Browse open translation requests and submit your translation for a specific language.
- Earn initial bounties plus royalties proportional to the content's popularity (e.g., views or integrations).
- Participate in verifications to earn extra rewards and build reputation.

**For Verifiers**
- Review submitted translations for accuracy and cultural nuance.
- Vote to approve or reject, with consensus required for final acceptance.
- Get rewarded from the bounty pool, with bonuses for accurate verifications.

**For Users/Consumers**
- Access verified translations via the platform's query functions.
- Content usage (e.g., API calls or views) triggers micro-royalty distributions to contributors.

The platform uses blockchain to ensure all interactions are tamper-proof, with smart contracts handling automation for fairness and efficiency.

## 📜 Smart Contracts

This project involves 8 Clarity smart contracts to manage the decentralized ecosystem securely:

1. **UserRegistry.clar**: Handles user registration, profiles, and reputation scores for creators, translators, and verifiers.
2. **ContentSubmission.clar**: Allows creators to submit content hashes, specify languages, and set bounties.
3. **TranslationSubmission.clar**: Enables translators to submit translations linked to content IDs.
4. **Verification.clar**: Manages verification votes by native speakers, requiring consensus (e.g., 3/5 approvals).
5. **RoyaltyManagement.clar**: Tracks usage metrics and distributes royalties automatically using oracles or on-chain events.
6. **Escrow.clar**: Secures funds in escrow until translations are verified and approved.
7. **DisputeResolution.clar**: Facilitates disputes with voting mechanisms and potential slashing of reputation/stakes.
8. **Governance.clar**: Allows token holders to propose and vote on platform upgrades, like fee adjustments.

These contracts interact seamlessly: for example, a successful verification in Verification.clar triggers releases from Escrow.clar and updates in RoyaltyManagement.clar.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To deploy and test:
- Install Clarity tools and Stacks wallet.
- Deploy contracts in order (start with UserRegistry).
- Use the Stacks testnet for development.
- Integrate with a frontend for user-friendly interactions.
